V = (x1, x2, x0)
X = {x0, x1, x2}
Note that the ordering of the variables in X is the canonical ordering
(ascendingly according to their labels) but the ordering in V is different.

The permutation between both variable orderings is sigma = (2, 0, 1), or more verbosely:
  sigma[0] = 2
  sigma[1] = 0
  sigma[2] = 1
This means that variable V[sigma[n]] should correspond with the n'th variable in X (for n=0,...,2)...OK. 

The states of the variables x0,x1,x2 are, according to the ordering in V:
SV:  x0:  x1:  x2:
 0    0    0    0
 1    0    1    0
 2    0    2    0
 3    0    0    1
 4    0    1    1
 5    0    2    1
 6    1    0    0
 7    1    1    0
 8    1    2    0
 9    1    0    1
10    1    1    1
11    1    2    1

The states of the variables x0,x1,x2 are, according to the canonical ordering in X:
SX:  x0:  x1:  x2:
 0    0    0    0
 1    1    0    0
 2    0    1    0
 3    1    1    0
 4    0    2    0
 5    1    2    0
 6    0    0    1
 7    1    0    1
 8    0    1    1
 9    1    1    1
10    0    2    1
11    1    2    1

The permutation sigma induces the following permutation of linear indices of joint states:
SV:  SX:
 0    0
 1    2
 2    4
 3    6
 4    8
 5   10
 6    1
 7    3
 8    5
 9    7
10    9
11   11

X = {x0,x1}

Var x0 has 2 states (possible values).
Var x1 has 3 states.

VarSet {x0,x1} has 6 states (joint assignments of its variables).

States of VarSets correspond to states of their constituent Vars:
  state of x0:   state of x1:   state of X:
    0              0              0
    1              0              1
    0              1              2
    1              1              3
    0              2              4
    1              2              5

And vice versa:
  state of x0:   state of x1:   state of X:
    0              0              0
    1              0              1
    0              1              2
    1              1              3
    0              2              4
    1              2              5
